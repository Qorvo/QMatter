 * @defgroup ELMIF_NVM Element interface NVM functions
 * @brief This file contains element specific interface to the gpNvm component
 *
 *  This header is implicitly included via the main interface header if the element interface
 *  diversity is selected.
 *  The element interface version of the gpNvm component treats various NVM attributes
 *  in a different way than the standard gpNvm version. In the standard version the components
 *  register arrays of tags for the NVM attributes which form sections belonging to its component.
 *  Tag IDs are derived implicitly from the index of a tag within the section array and if application
 *  was to configure a component in such way that attributes are added or dropped, the implicit
 *  tag IDs could change. In addition to that, the attributes are placed in the NVM one after another
 *  without embedding information to help disambiguate them when the firmware changes.
 *
 *  The element interface offers solution to this problem having in mind also the possibility to reuse
 *  inherited standard NVM by the element interface compatible application. The following image illustrates
 *  the reference situation (NVM usage of last non-up/downgradeable firmware) and relationship of it to the
 *  unique IDs of the attributes:
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Reference_NVM_and_mapping_to_UIDs.png "Reference NVM and mapping to UIDs" width=12cm
 *
 *  To resolve the issue of lacking the information about the attributes in the inherited standard NVM,
 *  the application is required to provide this information in a form of a program memory look-up table
 *  as illustrated in the following image:
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_ElemIf_based_application_and_inherited_NVM.png "Element interface based application and inherited NVM" width=12cm
 *
 *  Element interface based application is allowed to add/remove attributes and change attribute sizes
 *  (with limitation that the common denominator always stays alligned to the beginning of the attribute).
 *  The information about the added content into the NVM is embedded in the NVM as linked list of look-up tables.
 *  Initial program memory based look-up table is used as starting point for parsing of this linked list.
 *  Each time some component registeres attribute not known already in the NVM, NVM look-up table gets extended
 *  with this information and new attribute gets its space reserved in the NVM.
 *  Look-up tables are NVM elements themselves and as such are limited in size so the link list chaining
 *  is provided as mechanism for further extension.
 *
 *  The following images illustrate several typical situations of firmware upgrades and downgrades causing
 *  redefinition of the attributes:
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Upgrading_to_increased_attributes.png "Upgrading to attribute increased in size" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Downgrading_to_smaller_attributes.png "Downgrading to attribute smaller in size" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Upgrading_to_decreased_attriutes.png "Upgrading to attribute decreased in size" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Downgrading_to_larger_attributes.png "Downgrading to attribute larger in size" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Upgrading_to_added_attributes.png "Upgrading by adding attributes" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Downgrading_to_less_attributes.png "Downgrading to smaller number of attributes" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Upgrading_to_less_attributes.png "Upgrading to smaller number of attributes" width=12cm
 *
 *  Elements themselves are defined in the NVM in two ways. The inherited NVM has implicit definition of the
 *  elements as inherited attributes and their sizes. The subsequent elements are added in the NVM in a platform
 *  specific way. Simple way to implement platform specific element access is to have a table of fixed size
 *  located right after the inherited NVM. This table can contain array of values (8 or 16 bit) specifying element
 *  sizes. It should be initialized to all 1 values (all 0 and all 1 values indicating void element). Elements
 *  would be added one after another and the size array would be updated accordingly. When locating the element
 *  within the NVM, first query would be made to program memory look-up table. If element is not found there,
 *  the NVM element size array located right after the last known inherited attribute could be used to locate
 *  noninherited elements.
 *
 *  The explained manipulations with NVM based look-up tables are illustrated in the following images:
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Extending_NVM_LUT.png "Extending the existing NVM LUT with additional element" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Adding_NVM_LUT.png "Adding NVM LUT with refering to newly added element" width=12cm
 *
 *  @image latex NVM_Calculation_of_the_address_of_the_element.png "Calculation of the address of the element in the NVM" width=12cm
 *
 *  All of the premises for the driver stated so far imply that the way the attributes are registered to the
 *  NVM driver had to change. Information about attribute identity has to be provided explicitly rather than
 *  implicitly so new registration function is introduced. Elements may be registered individualy or in group(s) where
 *  order (IDs within componen or componets them selves) is not relevant. Any mix is possible, match will be found.
 *  Since the element tags had to change in structure to accomodate this explicit information, opportunity is taken
 *  to also change the way the default value initialization is done. Instead of providing the pointer to default data (if any)
 *  a default initialization function reference is provided making large sparse default information compressed beter in the
 *  program memory.
 *  Another addition to the tag is element (and not section) specific consistency checker function reference that can be
 *  used to asses integrity per attribute.
 *
 *  The special attention is given to make the best effort approach in reusing the attribute values when traversing among
 *  the firmware versions. The standard applications have the first attribute contain the CRC signing the section-attribute
 *  structure of the NVM. The element interface based applications will reconstruct this information from the program memory
 *  look-up table and will be able to asses if the inherited NVM is valid. This information is not dependant on the actual
 *  attributes used by the element interface based application.
 *  All of the reused attributes are updated in the inherited memory and if some attributes are extended, only the delta of the
 *  extended attribute will be allocated in the separate NVM element.. Initial value of
 *  extended attribute will be composite of already present value in inherited attribute and the rest will be default initialized.
 *  In unlikely event of reducing the inherited attribute size, the part of the inherited arribute known and used by the new
 *  application will be kept up to date.
 *  IMPORTANT NOTE: although in most of cases this approach provides valid attribute data when up or downgrading, care must be taken
 *  that the attribute values created by default extension of previous shorter attributes or by truncating previous longer attributes
 *  actually make sense. It is recommended to use consistency checker functions if the consistency can be broken by up/downgrading.
 *
 *  Compatibility between the applications in regard to NVM is defined by two requirements:
 *  - All mutually compatible versions have to use same base program memory LUT content
 *  - All mutually compatible versions have to use same unique IDs for same attributes
 *
 *  One special situation occurs with applications offering remote NVM service over the serial interface. The RW_NVM storage is allocated
 *  as array of elements that total in size required remote NVM. These elements are attributes being registered with common tag ID
 *  but internally their ID is incremented on every registration of such special element to stop them from being treated as one
 *  single attribute.
