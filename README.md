## Introduction
The [Matter&trade; standard](https://buildwithmatter.com/) (formerly Project Connected Home over IP or Project CHIP) is an industry-unifying standard for IoT. It defines a unified application layer and data model for devices operating with different IP protocols including Wi-Fi and Thread. The Matter stack is developed and maintained as an open-source project. Matter technology is built around four core principles:
<ol>
    <li> Simplicity </li>
    <li> Interoperability </li>
    <li> Reliability </li>
    <li> Security </li>
</ol>

For more information about the Matter standard, please refer to [the Matter codebase used in this SDK](https://github.com/Qorvo/connectedhomeip/tree/v1.0.0.0-qorvo) and the [Connectivity standards alliance website on the Matter protocol](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/).

The QPG6105 SoC is a future-proof multi-standard Smart Home communications controller supporting Matter standard. It features
ConcurrentConnect&trade; technology which enables multiple protocols (ZigBee, Thread and/or Bluetooth&reg; LE) to operate
simultaneously in a single chip design. This ensures compatibility with any open low-power standard ecosystem.

## Matter architecture

In the picture below you can find an overview of a Matter node architecture:

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/architecture.png" alt="Matter application architecture" width="500">
</div>

A Matter node represents a single device in the Matter network. Each Matter node application layer (dark blue blocks) is
defined by Matter data model layer. The data model layer is defined by a set of clusters. These clusters contain
commands and attributes that can be accessed over the Matter network. There are two types of clusters. **Base clusters**
and **Application clusters**. Base clusters are clusters that do not implement an application specific feature set. These
are used for management and diagnostic purposes in the Matter network. These are common for all Matter devices.
Application clusters are used to enable specific functionalities that are application specific (e.g. Temperature
measurement, On/Off and level for lighting, etc.). The **Application layer** implements the actual product behavior such
as the toggling/dimming the light, temperature sensing, etc...

Next, there is the actual **Matter stack**. The Matter stack is built as a library and contains the software that is
hosted in the Matter open-source repository. As part of the Matter network layer, the **OpenThread stack** is used.
Its source code is hosted in the OpenThread open-source repository. This software stack is built as part of the
[QMatter examples builds that can be found in Applications/Matter](Applications/Matter).

Next, there are the glue components that implement a glue layer between the Matter/OpenThread stack and the Qorvo
platform code. These glue components are **Matter-Qorvo glue** and **OpenThread-Qorvo glue**. These are also delivered
as seperate libraries ([Matter-Qorvo glue](Libraries/Qorvo/MatterQorvoGlue) and
[OpenThread-Qorvo glue](Libraries/Qorvo/OpenThreadQorvoGlue)).

Finally, There is the **Qorvo stack** which implements the IEEE802.15.4 stack, Bluetooth® LE stack, Security code and
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) towards the QPG6105. This library also contains the Board Support Package (BSP) that
can be updated to match the final product hardware. This [Qorvo stack is provided as a library build](Libraries/Qorvo/QorvoStack) as well.

## Building and flashing the example applications

### Prerequisites
Qorvo IoT Dev Kit for QPG6105 is based on Make.

The toolchain being used for this SDK is the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain (version 9-2019-q4-major). This is a ready-to-use, open-source suite of tools for C, C++ and assembly programming.

Matter code requires the [GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/) tool to be installed. This is a meta-build system that generates build files for [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

To make sure all prerequisites are fulfilled and before running any build command, the `Scripts/activate.sh` environment setup script should be sourced at the top level. This script takes care of downloading the toolchain, GN, ninja, and setting up the build environment.

```
source Scripts/activate.sh
```

The first time this scripts gets executed, it will create the environment from scratch which takes some time for downloading and installing.

### Building
First make sure the environment and environment variables are set correctly as mentioned above:

```
source Scripts/activate.sh
```

All builds are based on Make

```
cd Applications/Matter/light
make -f Makefile.light_qpg6105_development clean
make -f Makefile.light_qpg6105_development
```

This will result in `.hex` in `Work/light_qpg6105/light_qpg6105.hex`

### Flashing
Make sure the development kit is connected to your computer using the USB-C port on the IoT Dev Kit for QPG6105.

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/board_top.jpg" alt="QPG6105 Smart Home and Lighting Carrier Board" width="400">
</div>

The development kit has an onboard SEGGER J-Link debug probe. When the device is enumerated successfully, a virtual
COM port (`/dev/ttyACMx`) and a storage device (*JLINK*) will be available for use.

The J-Link Software and Documentation pack can be downloaded from
[https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/).
Install it to `/opt/SEGGER`, and create a symlink to make this latest version available under `JLink`:

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/SEGGER/JLink
cd /opt/SEGGER
sudo tar xf /path/to/downloaded/JLink_Linux_V786h_x86_64.tgz
sudo ln -s JLink_Linux_V786h_x86_64 JLink
```

For easy programming of the `.hex` you can use the `program` target, as illustrated with following command:

```
make -f Makefile.light_qpg6105_development program
```

The same procedure can be followed for building the other Matter applications and the peripheral example applications.

In Windows, after installed the JLink software, open J-FLash Lite Vx.xxY (e.g. V7.80c). In J-Flash GUI, choose
Device: "QPG6105", Interface: "SWD" "4000kHz" and then press "OK". Erase chip before programming the device. Browse
the application image (base_qpg6105_xxxx.hex, light_qpg6105_xxxx.hex, lock_qpg6105_xxxx.hex, switch_qpg6105_xxxx.hex
or thermostaticRadiatorValve_qpg6105_xxxx.hex) you want to program, and then click "Program Device". This operation
will trigger the development board hardware to transfer the image file to the QPG6105's program flash.Finally, the
board gets flashed in a couple of seconds. Note that pre-build hex-files are provided under [Binaries/](Binaries/),
while the output of locally built applications will be found under Work/.


## Enable serial logging
First make sure the development kit is connected to your computer using the USB-C port on the IoT Dev Kit for QPG6105.
As mentioned above, a virtual COM port (`/dev/ttyACMx`) will be available for use.

Next you can use a serial terminal application to connect to the COM port. In this example, we will be using Minicom.
This tool can be installed using following command:

```
sudo apt-get install minicom
```
After the installation, start minicom using following options:

```
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

Please note that the COM port number and device label **may differ** on your computer.

After resetting the programmed QPG6105 (press the button `SW6 RADIO RESET`), you will see similar output as below:

```
NRT ROM v1
qvCHIP <version> ROMv1/1 (CL:0) r:3
ResetCount[0]

```

## Debugging the example application

The IoT Dev Kit for QPG6105 has an onboard JLink based debugger which can be used to debug the reference applications in this SDK. Refer to [this debugging guide](Documents/Guides/debugging_with_segger_ozone.md) if you are interested in using Segger Ozone for debugging.

## Matter test setup
To start using the Matter applications, we need a 802.15.4-enabled Matter network to commission the device. This
requires a Thread Border Router and a Matter controller. For doing Over-the-Air download and upgrade also a Matter
OTA provider is needed. As part of the Matter SDK, these tools are provided as well.

### OpenThread Border Router
Implementation of the OpenThread Border Router is part of Qorvo IoT Dev Kit for QPG7015M. Refer to [QGateway](https://github.com/Qorvo/QGateway) if you are interested in building an OpenThread Border Router as part of the Matter network.

In this SDK, step-by-step instructions are given how to setup an Matter network based on this QPG7015M Dev Kit. See
[How to setup the OpenThread Border Router](Documents/Guides/setup_qpg7015m_ot_borderrouter.md)

### Matter Controller
Commissioning a device onto the Matter network is done by initiating a connection over Bluetooth LE between the Matter
controller and Matter device. Here the Matter controller has the commissioner role. The commissioner is responsible for
providing all necessary information to the Matter device to securely operate in the Matter network. This information
includes:
- **Onboarding information** (device discriminator, setup PIN code). This information needs to come from the Matter device itself (encoded in
a QR code or exposed through UART interface).
- **Thread credentials**. These are the Thread network credentials so it can join the 802.15.4 based Thread mesh network.

A terminal based Matter controller called **chip-tool** is provided for development and testing purposes and can be used
on a PC with Ubuntu 20.04+ or RPi model 4 running Ubuntu 20.04+.  This tool is developed by the CSA Matter development
team, and we provide [Instructions for commissioning and controlling the Matter device](Documents/Guides/commissioning_posix_cli_chiptool.md).

### Matter OTA Provider
To do a device upgrade over the Matter protocol, an OTA provider node needs to be available in the Matter network. An OTA provider
node is the node that can supply the available software update to the OTA requestor node. In this case the QPG6105 Matter
node will be the OTA requestor. This node will query the OTA provider node for a software update.

The OTA provider application is made available for testing purposes in this SDK (for Linux 64-bit PC/RPi). Step-by-step
instructions how to use the tool can be found [here](Documents/Guides/ota_device_firmware_upgrade.md).

## Product Test Component
Product Test Component (PTC) is a piece of software that is used to configure the radio chip in test modes enabling
measurements of the RF performance during design, validation, certification or production testing. To get started with PTC,
please refer to this [quick reference](Applications/PTC/README.md).

> **WARNING:** To control the PTC software, additional tooling, called Radio Control Console (RCC), on an external PC is
> needed. This RCC tooling is only supported for Windows machines. So make sure if you want to start using PTC software,
> a Windows machine is at hand.

> **WARNING:** In the QPG6105 radio board design, the diversity antenna efficiency is not fully optimized. It is not
> recommended to evaluate the maximum range of the QPG6105 using the development kit hardware. Qorvo’s production boards
> and customer layouts typically achieve -2 dBm to -3 dBm antenna efficiency.
