# Appendix

## LZMAFlow-GCC-license
### Compression PC Software Tool

The Software included in this package contains PC tools to compress the over-the-air downloadable
Firmware Update images. These PC tools make use of the LZMA SDK v19.00. LZMA SDK v19.00 is
available for download through [https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)

LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original LZMA SDK code,
either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.

### Embedded LZMAFlow decompression

LzmaFlow is re-factored code from lzmaSDK, specifically the decompressor function LzmaDecode()
from lzma443.tar.bz2. The modifications make the code easier to understand and easier to adapt for
specific purpose. The changes introduce a separate variable for each unique data flow, encapsulate
the probability state machine in a single small function, and avoid torturous macro syntax. Inserting
or deleting a single inline keyword moves between fastest and smallest code. Applying minor tweaks
by hand to the assembly language generated by gcc can produce object code that is simultaneously
fastest and smallest. The author of the original lzma443 expressed little interest in the modifications.

LzmaFlow version 0.2 is used, available for download here:
http://www.bitwagon.com/LzmaFlow/LzmaFlow.html
The download file http://BitWagon.com/LzmaFlow/LzmaFlow-0.2.tgz (212KB) includes the modified
LzmaDecodeFlow.c, the hand-compiled assembly language source files, and the original source
lzma443.tar.bz2 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/.

The LZMA decompression algorithm used in this software has originally been developed by Igor
Pavlov and licensed under either LGPL or CPL. It has then been put in the public domain on December
2, 2008, with the release of LZMA SDK version 4.62. Hand-optimized assembly for ARM and ARM
Thumb ISA were contributed by John F. Reiser. These contributions are licensed under LGPL 2.1
or CPL 1.0. Additional contributions by ubisys technologies GmbH ("Commercial Contributor") are
released under a commercial license, and include adaptations to the IAR assembler, making the
LZMA decompressor entirely a Thumb function, introducing the concept of a platform-agnostic page
buffer, and platform-specific flash routines, to allow for progressive flash-to-flash decompression of
the LZMA stream. Further modifications were made by Qorvo to make this code compatible with
GCC compiler.
These modifications can only be used in connection with the Ubisys ZigBee stack or with another
protocol.
That is, the modifications to the LzmaFlow code in the assembly code can be used in connection with
the Ubisys Zigbee stack, or in connection with a non-Zigbee solution like Bluetooth, matter, Thread,
rf4ce, Green Power Device, or any other non-ZigBee protocol.

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

#### Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
packages–typically libraries–of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.
You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that
you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to
the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this
license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.
Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
they have is not the original version, so that the original author’s reputation will not be affected by
problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make
sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive
license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.
This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of
the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General
Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library

We call this license the “Lesser” General Public License because it does Less to protect the user’s
freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers
Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we
use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use
of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely
used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number
of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users’ freedom, it does ensure
that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention
to the difference between a “work based on the library” and a “work that uses the library”. The former
contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

#### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
**0.** This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this Lesser General Public License (also called “this License”). Each licensee is addressed as
“you”.

A “library” means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The “Library”, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
these terms. A “work based on the Library” means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term “modification”.)

“Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of
the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of
the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s complete source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based
on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

**• a)** The modified work must itself be a software library.

**• b)** You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change.

**• c)** You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License.

**• d)** If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an
application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied
function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works
in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a
work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

**3.** You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License
to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you
can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not
a library.

**4.** You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object
code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

**5.** A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the
Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a “work that uses the Library”. Such a work, in
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a “work that uses the Library” with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a “work that uses the
library”. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a “work that uses the Library” uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the
object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work
under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

**6.** As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a “work that uses the Library”
with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer’s own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the
work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do
one of these things:

**• a)** Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the
Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
complete machine-readable “work that uses the Library”, as object code and/or source code, so
that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions
files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)

**• b)** Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user’s computer
system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly
with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

**• c)** Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same
user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
performing this distribution.

**• d)** If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

**• e)** Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already
sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the “work that uses the Library” must include any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the
materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries
that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use
both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

**7.** You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities
is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

**• a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

**• b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

**8.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

**9.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
(or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

**10.** Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise
of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.

**11.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.

**12.** If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or
by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**13.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of
this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

**14.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions
are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

### NO WARRANTY
**15.** BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**16.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
